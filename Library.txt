#
# text: ## Getting Started
# text: ### The Example Library
# text: It is not necessary to clone or download the whole repository. All you need is a [`Setup`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/sdc/main/Setup) script and a library configuration file. An example library file is available as [`Library.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/sdc/main/Library.txt). It includes _**fifteen freeware games**_ ready to play. Steps to follow:
# text:
# text: 1. Create an empty library directory.
# text: 2. Download the `Library.txt` configuration file and the `Setup` script.
# text: 3. Make the `Setup` script executable.
# text: 4. Run the `Setup` script.
# text:
# text: ```shell
# text: mkdir sdc-example
# text: cd sdc-example
# text: curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/sdc/main/Library.txt" -o Library.txt
# text: curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/sdc/main/Setup" -o Setup
# text: chmod a+x Setup
# text: ./Setup
# text: ```
# text:
# text: 5. Once the library is ready, go to the desired game directory.
# text: 6. Run the `Launch` script and enjoy the game.
# text:
# text: ```shell
# text: cd "Games/By Genre/Adventure/Beneath a Steel Sky"
# text: ./Launch
# text: ```
# text:
# text: ### Setting Up a Library
# text: If you have a `Library.txt` configuration file available, all you need is the `Setup` script:
# text:
# text: 1. Go to the directory where the `Library.txt` configuration file resides.
# text: 2. Download the `Setup` script.
# text: 3. Make the `Setup` script executable.
# text: 4. Run the `Setup` script.
# text: 5. Once the library is ready, go to the desired program directory.
# text: 6. Run the `Launch` script.
# text:
# text: ```shell
# text: cd [path/to/library]
# text: curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/sdc/main/Setup" -o Setup
# text: chmod a+x Setup
# text: ./Setup
# text: cd [path/to/program]
# text: ./Launch
# text: ```
# text:
# text: ### Setting Up a Program (Without Library)
# text: If you have a single `Program.txt` configuration file and want to run it without setting up the whole library, you can download the `Setup` script as `Launch`:
# text:
# text: 1. Go to the directory where the `Program.txt` configuration file resides.
# text: 2. Download the `Setup` script as `Launch` (use the `curl -o` option to rename the output).
# text: 3. Make the `Launch` script executable.
# text: 4. Run the `Launch` script.
# text:
# text: ```shell
# text: cd [path/to/program]
# text: curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rarioj/sdc/main/Setup" -o Launch
# text: chmod a+x Launch
# text: ./Launch
# text: ```

If you want to get ahead in the competitive corporate corridors of WAR, you need to master the use of human-assisted robots (HARs). These gigantic robots' purposes include defence and controlling far-flung planetary outposts. The next outpost up for colonization is Jupiter's moon Ganymede. The highly-paid job as pilot of the WAR representative will compete fiercely, and you must qualify for the position by proving your worth in the arena. It will be the grandest one-on-one combat since the Roman Era.
