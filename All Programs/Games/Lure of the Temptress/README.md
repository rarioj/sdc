# Lure of the Temptress

> ❝ You play Diermot, who finds himself imprisoned in a depressing cell. Meanwhile, life in the village of Turnvale goes on as ever, just an ordinary day. Well, as normal as you could hope for, considering the Skorl are in town. They're big, ugly, and not particularly pleasant! Will they overpower Diermot? Or can he escape from his cell and bring peace back to the land? It depends on you. ❞
